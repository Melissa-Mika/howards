                Our bait and tackle store has everything you need for your camping and fishing needs. We have camping
                supplies, including tents and lanterns. Firewood is for sale and is cut daily. We most likely carry
                anything you forgot to pack for your visit. Our fishing supplies are vast and include items such as
                fishing rods, spools, vests, coolers, and of course lots of types of live bait. Our staff are well
                versed on camping and fishing gear and are also available for guided fishing tours. You can obtain your
                fishing license here as well as have your rod and reel repaired. Our store also offers clothing should
                you have forgotten sweatshirts or dry weave clothing to keep you dry while out on the water.

            <p class="laketext">
                Lake Big Fish is the cornerstone of our slice of paradise. It is full of fish, including bass, walleye,
                and trout. Get your fishing gear from our store and be prepared to have a blast fishing from the shore
                or out on the lake. The lake is 2 miles long and 1 mile wide, a perfect size to explore. Our lake was
                voted "best lake to fish" for 3 years in a row.

            <p class="kayaktext">
                The fishing is great off of the shore, but we also have our lake to explore. If you would like to be out
                on the water, you can rent one of our kayaks or canoes and paddle to the other side of the lake, where
                we also have areas for picnics and swimming. There are also great areas along the shoreline for fishing.

                cabins, which are fully furnished with a kitchen. Each campsite has a place to build your campfire and
                firewood is sold at the bait shop. There is a picnic table at each site as well, making a great place to
